# Data-Science
A heap is a special tree structure in which the node is less than or equal to its child.

A heap is created using pythhon's library named heapq. In this library there are various functions that can be used to perform operations on heap data structure. These functions include:
Heapify which converts a regular list to a heap.
Heappush which adds an element to the heap without altering the current heap.
Heappop which returns and removes the smallest data element from the heap.
Heapreplace which replaces the smallest data element with a new value in the function.
 
A heap is crreated by using a list of elements with the heapify element

Uses of heaps
Scheduling Tasks. Heaps can be used to schedule a task based on their property
Memory Management. Heaps are used to allocate and dellocate memory efficiently.
Priority Queues. In this heaps can be used to implement priority queues where elements with higher priority are retrieved before elements with lower priority
